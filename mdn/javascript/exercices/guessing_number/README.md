# My first game!!
## Guessing Number Game

This simple game was proposed by the "Learn" area in MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash)
So, I just read the upcoming briefing next to the live example and tried myself to replicate it without any other information from this special page.
But I wasn't able to do it all by my previous knowledge, then I needed to peek some little things, just like generating randoms numbers.
